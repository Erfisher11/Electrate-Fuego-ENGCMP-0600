<!--Hello maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it--for this might be a really intersection on your way to becoming. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other, but explains a little more about the discourse communities that have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual. 

You could do it the easy way like I once did: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/ , or you can do a little more unconcealing...not just unconcealing who you are, but opening these tools that you use everyday, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to really understand our tools and how they work. So let's cut it all open--using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it...lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! 

In this doc., you will work through Gregory Ulmer's four discourses of family, entertainment, community, and schooling ((2002). Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy.) Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. I hope you are excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?--> 
    
 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own Electrate experience.--> 

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want--><!--this other stuff below the title does important work to help tell different browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->

You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder (directory) as this project (hint: simplify the name). Change the other relevant information, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"'--whatever that is?-->

  <h2>Family has always consisted of people I care about and can talk to about anything. It doesn't matter if we're related by blood, sweat, tears, or by anything other than existing in this same timeline. What matters is the connection that I place in them, and how I share my thoughts and feelings with them regularly. My family, containing both blood relatives and the best of friends, mean the world to me because they are always willing to listen and/or lend me a hand. Whether it's words of encouragement, late night talks to flesh out emotions and ideas, or any form of communication. My family is always there to assist in any way they can.
        My family has most notably gotten me to where I am by raising me and staying by my side through any event life has thrown at me. Every nasty breakup, passing grade, or failing, my family is always there. They give me the encouragement I need in order to keep me focused on my goals of being a civil engineer in Sweden by the time I am 30 years old.</h2>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Gregory Ulmer, who we discussed above, says that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person and how you language yourself. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You will have some opportunities to add video content or other content. You might add an image (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) or perhaps add a photo grid like the one you did for "Family." Experiment. You can't break this thing!

  <h2>Entertainment has definitely been a medium I've used both to understand others, but also in interacting with people. There is nothing quite like sharing a youtube video with a friend, or performing a song in a symphony with fellow musicians. That's why beneath this paragraph I have put in photos from many of the meaningful groups I've performed with over my 21 years of life. In creating entertainment there is a form of expression, i think, that is what can make humans particularly unique. Everyone performs with their own style, but in an ensemble of any size or instrumentation, you have to work with those other individuals and work to create something beautiful as a group.</h2>

<!--So what exactly is you community. Is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and colleagues, you might find community across the frontiers of the living, the dead, and perhaps those who have never lived. I'll let you explain-->
        
  <h2>I do not simply have one community of which I am a part of. This is because my different communities fulfill different portions of my life. My main communities of which I am a part of are the clubs at Pitt in which I participate. Such as the American Society of Civil Engineers, Pitt Ballroom Club and Pitt Band. In these communities I find new friends, great coworkers, and people who are passionate about both similar things as me, but also different things. These clubs help me grow and reach outside of my comfort zone.
        My other community is less sentient, but alive nonetheless. For me, nature has always been a place where I find peace, fun, excitement, and danger. Sometimes this even occurs at the same time! Nature is just a community I've had since I was a child, and I very much enjoy being a part of it, as all living things are. Many of my stories involve this community, whether it's a bear attack in New Mexico, a boar encounter in the Alps of Switzerland, or a pleasant camping trip along Pine Creek, and because of all these stories and events in my life, they have shaped who I am today.</h2>

  <h2>I am a firm believer in the fact that people never stop learning unless they decide to flat out reject all new ideas that are put in front of them. Following along this principle I have learned a lot in my life thus far. I've learned leadership, teamwork, and survival skills from the Boy Scouts of America. I've learned academic subjects ranging from music to history to mathematics from public education. And I've learned social skills from every interaction I've ever had with both individuals and groups.
      All these learning experiences continually shape who I am as a person and as a member of society on an almost daily basis. Knowing this, I believe that this learning is taking me toward some higher plane of understanding. This is not to say it is putting me above my peers by any means, but is instead giving me tools and experience that I can use to relate to even more people. Instead of being pigeon-holed into only knowing one thing, I instead am expanding the scope of my knowledge so that I can interact with more and more people.
      I believe that this understanding that I am working toward is one of the main goals of human existence. Our search for knowledge and answers has caused so many events, it is hard to argue that this pursuit is not one of core motivations. Following this, I hope that I can both contribute to that higher understanding we strive for, but also that I will never regret what I've learned.</h2>
